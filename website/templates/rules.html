                    Chess is played on a chessboard, a square board divided into a grid of 64 squares (eight-by-eight) of alternating color (similar to the board used in draughts). Regardless of the actual colors of the board, the lighter-colored squares are called "light" or "white", and the darker-colored squares are called "dark" or "black". Sixteen "white" and sixteen "black" pieces are placed on the board at the beginning of the game. The board is placed so that a white square is in each player's near-right corner. Horizontal rows are called ranks, and vertical columns are called files.

                    Each player controls sixteen pieces:

                    At the beginning of the game, the pieces are arranged as shown in the diagram: for each side one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The pieces are placed, one per square, as follows:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Rooks are placed on the outside corners, right and left edge.</li>
                        <li>Knights are placed immediately inside of the rooks.</li>
                        <li>Bishops are placed immediately inside of the knights.</li>
                        <li>The queen is placed on the central square of the same color of that of the piece: white queen on the white square and black queen on the black square.</li>
                        <li>The king takes the vacant spot next to the queen.</li>
                        <li>Pawns are placed one square in front of all of the other pieces.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Popular mnemonics used to remember the setup are "queen on her own color" and "white on right". The latter refers to setting up the board so that the square closest to each player's right is white.

                    The player controlling the white pieces is named "White"; the player controlling the black pieces is named "Black". White moves first, then players alternate moves. Making a move is required; it is not legal to skip a move, even when having to move is detrimental. Play continues until a king is checkmated, a player resigns, or a draw is declared, as explained below. In addition, if the game is being played under a time control, a player who exceeds the time limit loses the game unless they cannot be checkmated.

                    The official chess rules do not include a procedure for determining who plays White. Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a Swiss system tournament or round-robin tournament) or, in the case of non-competitive play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of random choice is often employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in either hand; the other player chooses a hand to open and receives the color of the piece that is revealed.

                    <p>Each type of chess piece has its own method of movement. A piece moves to a vacant square except when capturing an opponent's piece.
                        Except for any move of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is captured (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square. The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game. The king can be put in check but cannot be captured
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The king moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A special move with the king known as castling is allowed only once per player, per game </li>
                        <li>A rook moves any number of vacant squares horizontally or vertically. It also is moved when castling.</li>
                        <li>A bishop moves any number of vacant squares diagonally. (Thus a bishop can move to only light or dark squares, not both.)</li>
                        <li>The queen moves any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
                        <li>A knight moves to one of the nearest squares not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares vertically—i.e. in an "L" pattern.) The knight is not blocked by other pieces; it jumps to the new location.</li>
                        <li>Pawns have the most complex rules of movement:
                            A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.
                            A pawn, unlike other pieces, captures differently from how it moves. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn. It cannot move to those squares when vacant except when capturing en passant.
                            The pawn is also involved in the two special moves en passant and promotion.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on the other side of the king, adjacent to it. It is not allowed to move both king and rook in the same time, because "Each move must be played with one hand only." Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold</p>

                        When a pawn advances two squares on its initial move and ends the turn adjacent to an enemy pawn on the same rank, it may be captured en passant by the enemy pawn as if it had moved only one square. This capture is legal only on the move immediately following the pawn's advance. The diagrams demonstrate an instance of this: if the white pawn moves from a2 to a4, the black pawn on b4 can capture it en passant, moving from b4 to a3, and the white pawn on a4 is removed from the board.

                    <h3 >Promotion</h3>
                    <p>If a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then promoted (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color at the choice of the player (a queen is usually chosen). The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces. Hence it is theoretically possible for a player to have up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all of their pawns are promoted. If the desired piece is not available, the player must call the arbiter to provide the piece.</p>

                    <h2>Check</h2>
                    <p>A king is in check when it is under attack by at least one enemy piece. A piece unable to move because it would place its own king in check (it is pinned against its own king) may still deliver check to the opposing player.It is illegal to make a move that places or leaves one's king in check. The possible ways to get out of check are:
                        <ul><li>Move the king to a square where it is not in check.</li>
                        <li>Capture the checking piece (possibly with the king).</li>
                        <li>Block the check by placing a piece between the king and the opponent's threatening piece.</li></ul>
                    If it is not possible to get out of check, the king is checkmated and the game is over (see the next section).
                    In informal games, it is customary to announce "check" when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. In formal competitions, however, check is rarely announced .</p>

The white king is threatened by the black queen; the empty square to which the king could move is also threatened; and the king cannot capture the queen, because it would then be in check by the rook.   </p>

                    <h3>Resigning</h3>
                    <p>Either player may resign at any time. Under USCF Rules, this concedes the game to the opponent. A player may resign by saying it verbally or by indicating it on the score sheet in any of three ways:
                        <ul>
                            <li>by writing "resigns",</li>
                            <li> by circling the result of the game, or</li>
                            <li>by writing "1–0" if Black resigns or "0–1" if White resigns.</li>
                            <li> Tipping over the king also indicates resignation, but it should be distinguished from accidentally knocking the king over.</li>
                        </ul>
                    Stopping both clocks is not an indication of resigning, since clocks can be stopped to call the arbiter. An offer of a handshake is sometimes used, but it could be mistaken for a draw offer.
                    Under FIDE Laws, a resignation by one player results in a draw if their opponent has no way to checkmate them via any series of legal moves, or a loss by that player otherwise</p>

                <div id="draw">
                    <h3>Draw</h3>
                    <p>The game ends in a draw if any of these conditions occur:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The player to move is not in check and has no legal move. This situation is called a stalemate.</li>
                            <li>The game reaches a dead position.</li>
                            <li>Both players agree to a draw after one of the players makes such an offer.</li>
                            <li>The player having the move claims a draw by correctly declaring that one of the following conditions exists, or by correctly declaring an intention to make a move which will bring about one of these conditions:</li>
                            <li>The same board position has occurred three times with the same player to move and all pieces having the same rights to move, including the right to castle or capture en passant (see threefold repetition rule).</li>
                            <li>There has been no capture or pawn move in the last fifty moves by each player, if the last move was not a checkmate (see fifty-move rule).</li>
                            <li>The arbiter intervenes to declare a draw, without a draw request necessary:</li>
                            <li>When the same board position has occurred five times (see fivefold repetition rule).</li>
                            <li>When the moves without capture or pawn move extend up to seventy-five (see seventy-five-move rule).</li>
                            <li>A player would normally lose by running out of time or by resigning, but their opponent has no way to checkmate them via any series of legal moves.</li>
                        </ul>
                        There is no longer a rule specifically defining perpetual check as a draw. In such a situation, either the threefold repetition rule or the fifty-move rule will eventually come into effect. More often, the players will simply agree to a draw.

                <div  id="dead-position">
                    <h3>Dead Position</h3>
                    <p>A dead position is defined as a position where neither player can checkmate their opponent's king by any sequence of legal moves. Although in practice players sometimes play on in dead positions, according to the rules of chess the game is immediately terminated the moment a dead position appears on the board.
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are two kinds of dead position:</li>
                        <li>Positions with only the following pieces. These are known as draws by insufficient material.</li>
                        <li>king against king</li>
                        <li>king against king and bishop</li>
                        <li>king against king and knight</li>
                        <li>king and bishop against king and bishop, with both bishops on squares of the same color (see King and two bishops)</li>
                        <li>Other positions in which checkmate is impossible by any sequence of legal moves. This can occur in blocked positions where it is impossible for either side to make a capture.</li>
                    </ul>
                    USCF rules also allow draw claims for "insufficient losing chances" in positions such as king and knight against king and knight, where checkmate is only achievable with the co-operation of both players, but this sometimes requires arbiter discretion.</p>

            <div class="competition-rules">
                <h1 id="competition-rules">Competition Rules</h1>
                <p>The following rules are the rules used for over-the-board (OTB) games. They are defined by the FIDE Laws of Chess.The FIDE Laws of Chess define the rules for standard chess, rapid chess, blitz chess, and guidelines for Chess960. For standard chess, the players must record the moves, which is optional in rapid chess and blitz Chess. Some rules are specifically adapted for disabled players. As the rules cover OTB play, they cannot be directly applied to computer chess or online chess, played on a computer device. The rules for correspondence chess are defined by the ICCF.</p>
                <h2 id="moving-pieces">Moving the pieces</h2>
                <p>The movement of pieces is to be done with one hand. Once the hand is taken off a piece after moving it, the move cannot be retracted unless the move is illegal.As for the touch-move rule, an arbiter who observes a violation of this rule must intervene immediately.A player must claim a violation of the rule immediately before making a move, or lose the right to claim.<br><br>
                    When castling, a player should first move the king with one hand and then move the rook with the same hand.In the case of a promotion, if a player releases the pawn on the eighth rank, the player must promote the pawn. After the pawn has moved, the player may touch any piece not on the board and the promotion is not finalized until the new piece is released on the promotion square.</p>
                    
                <h2 id="touch-move">Touch-move rule</h2>
                <p>In serious play, if a player having the move touches a piece as if having the intention of moving it, then the player must move it if it can be legally moved. So long as the hand has not left the piece on a new square, any legal move can be made with the piece. If a player touches one of the opponent's pieces then that piece must be captured if there is a legal move that does so. If none of the touched pieces can be moved or captured, there is no penalty. An arbiter who observes a violation of this rule must intervene immediately.A player must claim a violation of the rule immediately before making a move, or lose the right to claim.

                    When castling, the king must be the first piece touched. If the player touches the king and a rook, the player must castle with that rook if it is legal to do so. If the player completes a two-square king move without touching a rook, the player must move the correct rook accordingly if castling in that direction is legal. If a player starts to castle illegally, another legal king move must be made if possible, including castling with the other rook.<br><br>
                    
                    If a player moves a pawn to its eighth rank, it cannot be substituted for a different move of the pawn when the player has stopped touching it. The move is not complete, however, until the promoted piece is released on that square.<br><br>
                    
                    If a player touches a piece to adjust its physical position within a square, he must first alert his opponent by saying J'adoube or "I adjust". Once the game has started, only the player with the move may touch the pieces on the board.
                    
                </p>

                <h2 id="timing">Timing</h2>
                <p>Tournament games are played under time constraints, called time controls, using a chess clock. Each player is timed separately and must make moves within the time control or forfeit the game. There are different types of time controls applied. For standard chess, different periods can be defined with different fixed times (e.g. first 40 moves in 100 minutes, next 20 moves in 50 minutes, remaining moves in 15 minutes). For rapid and blitz chess, only one period can be defined where all moves must be performed. Additionally, an increment or delay per move may be defined.[39]

                    <ul>
                        <li>When a player runs out of time, this event is called flag-fall. A flag-fall has no consequences unless stated as observed by the arbiter, in which case the arbiter must intervene,[40] or claimed by a player.[41]</li>
                        <li>When no flag-fall is stated, and one of the following events occur, the result of the game still holds. It is of no relevance if the player runs out of time afterwards, or has already run out of time, but this was not stated:</li>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>If a player delivers a checkmate, the game is over and that player wins.[42]</li>
                            <li>If a move results in a stalemate, dead position, fivefold repetition or the seventy-five-move rule applies, the game is over and the game is drawn.[43]</li>
                            <li>If a player correctly claims flag-fall, that player wins. But if the claiming player is out of time, or could not still theoretically checkmate the opponent, the game is a draw.[44]</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    The United States Chess Federation (USCF) rule is different. USCF Rule 14E defines "insufficient material to win on time", that is lone king, king plus knight, king plus bishop, and king plus two knights opposed by no pawns, and there is no forced win in the final position. Hence to win on time with this material, the USCF rule requires that a win can be forced from that position, while the FIDE rule merely requires a win to be possible. (See Monika Soćko rules appeal in 2008 and Women's World Chess Championship 2008 for a famous instance of this rule.)
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>With mechanical clocks only, flag-fall for both players can occur. With digital clocks, the clock indicates which flag fell first, and this information is valid.[45]</li>
                        <li>If a flag-fall is stated, and as can happen with mechanical clocks only, the flag-fall happened for both players, then:[46][48]</li>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>If it can be established which player ran out of time first, the rules apply for flag-fall for one player only.</li>
                            <li>Otherwise, the result is a draw, unless this is a standard chess game which is not in the last period, here the play will be resumed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    In the last period of a standard chess game or rapid games, if played without increment, a special set of rules applies regarding the clock, referenced as "Quickplay Finishes".[49] These rules allow a player with under two minutes time to request an increment introduced, or request a draw based on claiming no progress or no effort, to be ruled by the arbiter. These rules have been relevant when playing with mechanical clocks, which do not allow setting an increment and are today with digital clocks of second importance only, as playing with increment is recommended.[50]

                    <h1>Equipment</h1>
                    <p>The size of the squares of the chessboard should be approximately 1.25 to 1.3 times the diameter of the base of the king, or 50 to 65 mm. Squares of approximately 57 mm (2+1⁄4 inches) normally are well-suited for pieces with the kings in the preferred size range. The darker squares are usually brown or green and the lighter squares are off-white or buff.</p>
                    <p>Pieces of the Staunton chess set design are the standard and are usually made of wood or plastic. They are often black and white; other colors may be used (like a dark wood or even red for the dark pieces) but they would still be called the "white" and "black" pieces (see White and Black in chess). The height of the king should be 85 to 105 millimetres (3.35–4.13 inches).[g][75] A height of approximately 95 to 102 mm (3+3⁄4–4 inches) is preferred by most players. The diameter of the king should be 40 to 50% of its height. The size of the other pieces should be in proportion to the king. The pieces should be well balanced.[76][h]</p>
                    <p>In games subject to time control, a chess clock is used, consisting of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously. The clock can be analog or digital though a digital clock is highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is since most tournaments now include either an increment (extra time being added prior or after the move) or delay (a countdown to when a clock starts again) to their time controls. Before the start of the game, either the arbiter or whoever is playing Black decides where the chess clock is placed.
